When does DoCo use end user information from third parties?

When you sign in using Apple Sign In, we receive your Apple ID, email address (or Apple's private relay email), and name (if provided). This information is used solely for account creation and authentication purposes.


Do we share the information we collect with third parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our app, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.

We use Supabase as our backend service provider for authentication, database, and storage. Your data is stored securely on Supabase servers.

We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.


How Long Do We Keep Your Information?

We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide DoCo to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.

Posts on DoCo are automatically deleted after 24 hours.


How Do We Protect Your Information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. We use secure servers and all data transmission is encrypted via SSL/TLS technology. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to DoCo or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.


Could my information be transferred to other countries?

DoCo is incorporated in Japan. Information collected via our app, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.

  -Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.
  -People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.
